# Network Design Project

## Overview

This project involves designing a comprehensive network for a multinational IT company's new overseas branch in Sri Lanka. The goal was to optimize the use of the provided IP address range and ensure secure and efficient network operations. This is an academic project completed as part of the EC4060 course.

## Project Components

- **Assignment Description**: Details of the academic assignment and requirements.
  - [Assignment_Description.pdf](Assignment_Description.pdf)

- **Final Report**: Detailed documentation of the network design, including subnets, VLANs, and configuration steps.
  - [Final_Report.pdf](Final_Report.pdf)

- **Network Design File**: Packet Tracer file containing the network topology and configuration (use version 8.2.2 to open).
  - [Network_Design.pkt](Network_Design.pkt)

## Key Features

- VLAN segmentation for enhanced security and optimized traffic.
- Configuration steps for routers and switches to ensure seamless inter-VLAN communication.
- Detailed WiFi access point configuration for full coverage.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- VLAN Configuration
- Access Control Lists (ACLs)

## How to Use

1. **View the Assignment Description**: Open the [Assignment_Description.pdf](Assignment_Description.pdf) to understand the academic requirements.
2. **View the Final Report**: Open the [Final_Report.pdf](Final_Report.pdf) to understand the design and implementation details.
3. **Open the Network Design File**: Use Cisco Packet Tracer version 8.2.2 to open the [Network_Design.pkt](Network_Design.pkt) file and explore the network topology.
